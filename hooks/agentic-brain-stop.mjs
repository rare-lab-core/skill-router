// Agentic Stop Check — Stop hook, fires when the assistant tries to end a turn.
//
// Encodes verify-before-done as a senior self-review gate: if this session did
// substantive work (any edit or commit, flagged by the PostToolUse result check)
// and the model is about to stop, ask it once to review its output against the
// senior bar — claims map to evidence, the goal is genuinely met, the diff is
// honest.
//
// Two independent loop-guards make a trapped turn impossible:
//   1. stop_hook_active — if the host reports we are already inside a
//      stop-hook-triggered continuation, never block again.
//   2. stopReminded ledger flag — the block fires at most once per session;
//      after it fires, the flag is set and it never blocks again.
// If neither the trigger nor the guards apply, the turn stops normally.
//
// Output contract: top-level decision "block" + reason forces the turn to
// continue; {} allows the stop.
